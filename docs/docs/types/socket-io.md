Socket I/O Data
===============

Data
----

For each unique call stack that performs I/O, gumshoe reports totals for read, write and combined:
number of calls, number of bytes, and elapsed time.  

Samples collected can be filtered by IP, mask and port to limit reports to only certain systems or services.

Hooks
-----

Socket I/O collection relies on [IoTrace](../hooks/io-trace.md) 
which provides a callback mechanism
for all I/O on normal (non-NIO) sockets, all NIO writes and NIO reads when in blocking mode.
To use this mechanism the gumshoe hook must override the JRE version of IoTrace
using the bootclasspath argument.

For NIO reads in non-blocking mode, a custom [SelectorProvider](../hooks/selector-provider.md) 
wraps default implementations and includes these reads using the normal IoTrace mechanism.

The callback to IoTrace creates an event which is queued and handled off the I/O thread.  The 
[event handler](../probe/event-handling.md) accumulates these events and reports a total per calling stack.

Limitations
-----------

- NIO non-blocking operations are asynchronous, so the time reported is really the time to pass
  the data into a buffer, not the actual I/O time.  The value is real and usable, representing
  how long the target application waited trying to perform I/O using the NIO library, but
  is not the same as TCP transmission time included in the non-NIO values for these statistics

- The event queue between IoTrace and the statistics accumulator can back up if I/O events are
  happening faster than the accumulator can process them.  This can result in two issues:
  
  - Statistics totals may lag the times reported.  For example, a summary of I/O reported at 12:00
    may actually only include events up to 11:59.  
  - While the queue capacity is exceeded, events may be dropped and a message is shown in STDOUT

  If this is happening occasionally during peak loads, it may not be an issue.  I/O statistics are still
  gathered -- reports just contain fewer samples when the queue is full.  If this is happening a lot during the loads
  being tested then look at then [event handler configuration](../probes/event-handling.md).
